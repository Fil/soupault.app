The source of the [soupault.neocities.org](https://soupault.neocities.org) website.

If you want to play with it to learn how it works and build a local copy,
you will need the following external tools:

* [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) for Markdown processing.
* [highlight](http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php) for syntax highlighting.

When you have those installed, run `make all`.
