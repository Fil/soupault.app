# Contributing to soupault

Soupault is free and open-source software, open for contributions. 

## Contributing to the soupault code

Soupault source code is available in two equally official locations:

* GitHub: <github>PataphysicalSociety/soupault</github>
* Codeberg: <codeberg>PataphysicalSociety/soupault</codeberg>

I keep those repositories in sync, and you can open a pull request in either of them.

Note that if you want to add a new built-in widget or make a big user-visible change,
itâ€™s better to discuss the idea with the maintainer first rather than make a patch right away.

## Contributing to the website

The website source code is also public and open for contributions:

* GitHub: <github>PataphysicalSociety/soupault</github>
* Codeberg: <codeberg>PataphysicalSociety/soupault</codeberg>

## Contributing plugins

If you wrote a plugin that can be useful for other people, feel free to nominate it for the [plugin directory](/plugins).

At the moment, plugins are in the [assets/files/plugins](https://github.com/PataphysicalSociety/soupault.app/tree/master/assets/files/plugins) directory.

You can either open a pull request on GitHub or [send a message](/support) to the mailing list or to me personally.
