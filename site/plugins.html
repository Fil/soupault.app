<h2>Generic</h2>

<h3>Conditional HTML insertion</h3>
<p>This plugin inserts an HTML snippet into the page iff that page has an element matching certain selector.</p>
<p>
The key difference from the built-in <code>insert_html</code> widget is that it can check for one element,
but insert in another. The element to check for is defined by the <code>check_selector</code> option,
while the <code>selector</code> option defines the target element to insert the snippet in.
</p>
<p>
For example, if some content requires some JavaScript to interpret, you may want to insert that JavaScript only in pages
that actually need it. Of course, that JS usually has to go to the page <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
not inside the content element, and you don't need it in <em>every</em> element, so <code>insert_html</code>
doesn't work well for this task.
</p>
<p>
One example is self-hosted <a href="https://asciinema.org">asciinema</a> player. It's smaller than a video
would be, but it's still quite a chunk of JS and it's better to insert it only in pages that have any <code>&lt;asciinema-player&gt;</code>
elements.
</p>
<p>
There are other possible uses of course. Here's an example that adds a warning to your page if it has any <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>
elements:
</p>
<pre>
[plugins.insert_if]
  file = "plugins/insert-if.lua"

[widgets.blink-warning]
  widget = "insert_if"
  html = "&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: blink elements are obsolete!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
  selector = "body"
  check_selector = "blink"
</pre>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<h3>Site URL</h3>
<p>
This plugin changes all relative links like <code>/about.html</code> to absolute like <code>https://www.example.com/about.html</code>.
Sample configuration:
</p>
<pre>
[plugins.site-url]
  file = "plugins/site-url.lua"

[widgets.set-site-url]
  widget = "site-url"
  site_url = "https://www.example.com"  
</pre>
<p>Download: <a href="/files/plugins/site-url.lua">site-url.lua</a>.</p>

<h3>Active link highlight</h3>
<p>
This plugin highlights the link to the current page/section in a navigation menu. You can see that the &ldquo;Plugins&rdquo; link
on this page is bold, it's what this plugin does (it adds a <code>nav-active</code> class to that link).
</p>
<p>
It assumes that you are using relative links and that you keep all navigation links inside one element (like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>).
It may require some tweaking for your website. Sample configuration:
</p>
<pre>
[plugins.section-link-highlight]
  file = "plugins/section-link-highlight.lua"

[widgets.nav-menu]
  widget = "include"
  file = "templates/menu.html"
  selector = "div#nav-menu"

[widgets.highlight-active-link]
  after = "nav-menu"
  widget = "section-link-highlight"
  selector = "div#nav-menu"
  active_link_class = "nav-active"
</pre>
<p>
If you keep navigation menu in a separate file like I do, the <code>after = </code> option is necessary for correct ordering,
otherwise the <code>highlight-active-link</code> widget may run before navigation links are actually available.

<h3>Page source link</h3>
<p>
For people who store their site source in a public repository. This plugin inserts a link to the page source file
in the repository, by appending the page file path to a base URL (the <code>repo_base</code> option).
