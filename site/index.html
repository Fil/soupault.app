<p>Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a static website generator.</p>
<p>
It's a tool that takes a page template and a directory with page content
files and builds a complete static website from it. This makes it easy to tweak the site layout without having to edit every page by hand.
It can include external files in your pages, set the page title, create footnotes and tables of contents for your pagesâ€”in short, help
you with tedious tasks that distract you from working on the site layout and content.
</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>
Soupault is different from existing projects in multiple ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can work with existing HTML, no need for Markdown etc.</li>
  <li>You can make all pages look different if you want.</li>
  <li>A theme/template is just an empty HTML page.</li>
  <li>It can preserve your existing site structure without breaking any links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>HTML first</h3>
<p>
Most website generators like Jekyll or Hugo are based on template processors.
Soupault is different because it uses HTML element tree manipulation, similar to DOM manipulation in JS (<code>getElementById</code> etc.),
so it's more like an automated HTML editor.
Its &ldquo;templates&rdquo; are really just HTML pages with some empty tags, rather than HTML interspersed with template processor macros.
Source and target elements for content extraction and insertion are identified using CSS selectors like <code>h1</code>, <code>div#content</code>,
or <code>.footnote</code>. You can tell it to set the page title to the content of the first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element, or insert <code>templates/footer.html</code>
into <code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>, and it will find those elements no matter where they are in the page.
</p>
<p>Despite its seemingly heavy-handed approach, soupault is reasonably fast and can build a site with a hundred pages in under a second.</p>
<h3>Perfect for Web 1.0</h3>
<p>
Many website generators are more like CMSes without a database and make it difficult to create free-form websites that people are turning
back to Web 1.0 for. Soupault is intentionally designed to make it possible but still automate the tedious tasks.
</p>
<p>
You can make every page look different if you want. You can store your assets (images, CSS...) together with pages in <code>site/</code>
and they will be copied unchanged. You can create a site section simply by making a subdirectory and dropping pages into it.
It's very easy to migrate to soupault from a handwritten website without breaking any internal or external links.
</p>
<p>
There is no artificial separation of theme and content. You decide how much is the theme and how much is the content, the minimal page template
is just <code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code>. You can setup a Web 2.0 style workflow with complete separation of the theme,
content, and assets, but you don't have to.
</p>
<h3>Extensible</h3>
<p>
You can configure soupault to automatically run convertors to HTML from other formats (Markdown, AsciiDoc...) and include output of external scripts in your pages.
You can also extend its functionality with Lua<span class="footnote">The only pitfall is that the language is Lua 2.5, not modern Lua 5.x. That's because
soupault uses a research implementation called Lua-ML that made some embedded intepreter design breakthroughs, but sadly isn't up to date with Lua standards.</span>
plugins.
</p>
<p>
You can also extract page metadata and export it to JSON for creating a list of all pages in a section or a blog feed. Elements to extract data from
are configured using CSS selectors like everything else, so you can add an autogenerated index to an existing site without having to rewrite any pages.
</p>
<h3>Useful built-ins</h3>
<p>There's built-in functionality for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including files or HTML snippets into any elements in your page.</li>
  <li>Setting the page title to the content of any element from the page.</li>
  <li>Creating tables of contents, footnotes, and breadcrumbs (all fully static, no JS required).</li>
  <li>Deleting HTML elements from certain pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you run soupault, it parses a page file, inserts its contents into an element in the template (by default, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag)
and runs the page HTML through one or more &ldquo;widgets&rdquo;. Output of one widget can be used as input for another. You can order
execution of widgets explicitly, e.g. to make sure ToC is created after all external files are included. It's also possible to set widgets
to run only on certain pages or site sections (directories).

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/howto">HOWTO</a> should be a good start. Then read the <a href="https://baturin.org/projects/soupault">reference manual</a> for details.
There's also a <a href="/blog">blog</a> with tips and tricks.
</p>

<h2>Why it's named soupault?</h2>
<p>
Soupault is named after the French dadaist and surrealist writer Philippe Soupault
because it's based on the <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a> library.
Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of 'Pataphysics</a>.<span class="footnote" id="pataphysics">Not really.</span>
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>
The soupault logo is a stick horse. It's a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary
at a random word and landed on &ldquo;dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse&rdquo;, which is why they named it &ldquo;dadaism&rdquo;.

<h2>Who's behind it?</h2>
<p>
So far just me, <a href="https://baturin.org">Daniil Baturin</a>, but everyone is welcome to send a patch/pull request or a suggestion.
It has grown out of the bunch of ad hoc scripts that used to power my own website, and then I thought I can as well make it usable
for everyone who finds other generators too annoying or too limiting.
