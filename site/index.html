<p>Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a static website generator.</p>
<p>
It's a tool that takes a page template and a directory with page content
files and builds a complete static website from it. This makes it easy to tweak the site layout without having to edit every page by hand.
It can include external files in your pages, set the page title, create footnotes and tables of contents for your pagesâ€”in short, help
you with tedious tasks that distract you from working on the site layout and content.
</p>
<p>
If you are already familiar with static generators like Jekyll or Hugo, you are likely wondering how soupault is different from them
and why make another one. The key difference is that soupault doesn't use a template processor. Instead of generating HTML, it
transforms and enhances it, using HTML element tree rewriting. Instead of making you supply page metadata in the &ldquo;front matter&rdquo;,
it can extract metadata from your pages. It's more like an automated HTML editor that can emulate a human webmaster.
</p>
<p>
This allows new possibilities such as setting page title to the first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> of the page, no matter where it's located in the page,
generating footnotes and ToC links with persistent anchors based on the <code>id</code> attribute of the heading or footnote paragraph elements,
or inserting different scripts and styles into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of certain pages.
</p>
<p>
Source and target elements for content extraction and insertion are identified using CSS selectors like <code>h1</code>, <code>div#content</code>,
or <code>.footnote</code>. The way soupault works is similar to DOM manipulation in JS, except it doesn't need a browser and produces static pages
that don't require any client-side scripts to work.
</p>
<p>
It also removes the artificial separation of theme and content and allows you to make every page look different if you feel like it. This makes soupault
especially suited for the Web 1.0 revival. You decide how much is the theme and how much is the content, the minimal page template
is just <code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>Despite its seemingly heavy-handed approach, soupault is reasonably fast and can build a site with a hundred pages in under a second.</p>

<h2>What can you do with it?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Include files, HTML snippets, or output of external programs/scripts in your pages.</li>
  <li>Automatically create tables of contents, footnotes, and breadcrumbs (fully static, no JS).</li>
  <li>Delete HTML elements from certain pages.</li>
  <li>Store pages in any format (Markdown, AsciiDoc...) that can be converted to HTML, if you specify a <a href="/howto/#preprocessors">preprocessor</a> for it.</li>
  <li>Get page metadata in JSON and generate a section index/blog feed from it.</li>
  <li>Add your own functionality with external scripts and plugins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a screencast of basic usage:</p>
<div> <script id="asciicast-271350" src="https://asciinema.org/a/271350.js" async></script> <br /></div>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/howto">HOWTO</a> should be a good start. Then read the <a href="https://baturin.org/projects/soupault">reference manual</a> for details.
There's also a <a href="/blog">blog</a> with tips and tricks.
</p>

<h2>Why it's named soupault?</h2>
<p>
Soupault is named after the French dadaist and surrealist writer Philippe Soupault
because it's based on the <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a> library.
Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of 'Pataphysics</a>.<span class="footnote" id="pataphysics">Not really.</span>
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>
The soupault logo is a stick horse. It's a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary
at a random word and landed on &ldquo;dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse&rdquo;, which is why they named it &ldquo;dadaism&rdquo;.

<h2>Who's behind it?</h2>
<p>
So far just me, <a href="https://baturin.org">Daniil Baturin</a>, but everyone is welcome to send a patch/pull request or a suggestion.
It has grown out of the bunch of ad hoc scripts that used to power my own website, and then I thought I can as well make it usable
for everyone who finds other generators too annoying or too limiting.
</p>

If you find a bug or have a feature request, create an issue on <a href="https://github.com/dmbaturin/soupault/issues">Github</a>.
Alternatively, you can send an email to <code>daniil+soupault@[my last name].org</code>. Feel free to send me messages on Neocities as well.

<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>Apart from built-in functionality, soupault offers a few ways to add your own.</p>
<h3>Running external scripts</h3>
<p>
Soupault can run external scripts and include their output in the page. It can also pass arguments to scripts, so that you can run
a script on the page source file (e.g. add automatically add last modification date to the page).
</p>
<h3>Index generators</h3>
<p>
While soupault, by itself, is not &ldquo;blog-aware&rdquo;, it can extract data from elements matching certain selectors from each page
(e.g. title from a <code>&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;</code> and date from <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>) and feed it to an external script.
This way you can make a blog, an Atom feed, or simply a list of all pages in a site section. You decide what data is extracted,
from which elements, and what the script does with it.
</p>
<h3>Lua plugins</h3>
<p>
If you want new ways to modify the HTML tree of your pages, you can do it with Lua plugins. There are Lua functions for creating elements,
deleting them, and setting attributes.
The only downside is that the extension language is Lua 2.5 rather than modern 5.x.<span class="footnote" id="lua-ml">That's because
soupault uses a research implementation named Lua-ML that includes many embedded interpreter design breakthroughs, but sadly
isn't up to date with the official Lua spec.</span>
