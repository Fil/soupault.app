<p>Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a static website generator and HTML processor.</p>
<p>These are some of the things it can do for you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assemble a complete website from a template (an empty page) and a directory with page body files.</li>
  <li>Insert files, HTML snippets, or output of external programs into your pages.</li>
  <li>Create a table of contents from the page headings.</li>
  <li>Create footnotes.</li>
  <li>Automatically call convertors from other format (Markdown etc.) to HTML.</li>
  <li>Delete unwanted elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
How it's different from other tools?
Website generators like Jekyll or Hugo <em>generate</em> HTML by filling the blanks in a template. Soupault parses HTML and then <em>transforms and enhances</em> it.
It allows you to do things that are impossible with tools based on template processors. For example, you can insert the content of <code>header.html</code> before the first element
in the page <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>footer.html</code> after the last element. Or insert the table of contents into a <code>&lt;div id="toc"&gt;</code>
even if it's in a different place in every page. Or set the page title to the content of the first <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element. Instead of template tags like
<code>{{content}}</code>, soupault uses CSS selectors to locate elements in the page, like <code>body</code>, <code>.footnote</code>, or <code>div#content</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you have a handwritten website, you can start using soupault right away to automate tedious tasks, and then gradually move the common layout
to the template if you want to. You can easily mix unique and templated pages. Soupault can check if a file is a complete page or a page body (by checking if there's an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in it),
so it knows whether to insert a page in the template first or just apply HTML transformation rules to it.
</p>
<p>
If you are using another static site generator and have your content in Markdown/reStructuredText/whatever format, you can configure soupault
to automatically <a href="/howto/#preprocessors">convert</a> your files to HTML before inserting it in the template.
</p>
<p>
While there's no built-in support for blogs, soupault can automatically extract page metadata and feed it to an external script, so you can create a blog,
a simple list of pages in a section, or some custom index from your pages. See <a href="/blog/blogs-and-section-indices">this post</a> for a simple blog recipe.
</p>
<p>
You can also extend its capabilities with Lua plugins.<span class="footnote" id="lua-2.5">The only pitfall is that the language is Lua 2.5, not modern Lua 5.x. That's because
soupault uses a research implementation called Lua-ML that made some embedded intepreter design breakthroughs, but sadly isn't up to date with Lua standards.</span>
Plugins have full access to the element tree of the page, much like JavaScript, but without a browser.
</p>
<p>Here's a screencast of basic usage:</p>
<div> <script id="asciicast-271350" src="https://asciinema.org/a/271350.js" async></script> <br /></div>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="/howto">HOWTO</a> should be a good start. Then read the <a href="/reference-manual">reference manual</a> for details.
There's also a <a href="/blog">blog</a> with tips and tricks.
</p>

<h2>Why it's named soupault?</h2>
<p>
Soupault is named after the French dadaist and surrealist writer Philippe Soupault
because it's based on the <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a> library.
Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of 'Pataphysics</a>.<span class="footnote" id="pataphysics">Not really.</span>
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>
The soupault logo is a stick horse. It's a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary
at a random word and landed on &ldquo;dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse&rdquo;, which is why they named it &ldquo;dadaism&rdquo;.

<h2>Who's behind it?</h2>
<p>
So far just me, <a href="https://baturin.org">Daniil Baturin</a>, but everyone is welcome to send a patch/pull request or a suggestion.
It has grown out of the bunch of ad hoc scripts that used to power my own website, and then I thought I can as well make it usable
for everyone who finds other generators too annoying or too limiting.
