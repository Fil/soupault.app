<p>Soupault (<em>soup-oh</em>) is a tool that helps you create and manage static websites.</p>
<p>
It&apos;s best described as a robotic webmaster. Like a human webmaster, it understands HTML, but doesn&apos;t get tired of editing it.
You can tell it to do things like <q>insert the HTML from <code>footer.html</code> after the last element in the page <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></q>.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, there was a dichotomy between unlimited possibilities of handwritten Web 1.0 pages and convenience of &ldquo;cookie cutter&rdquo;
tools (CMSes and classic static site generators). People often had to add JavaScript to non-interactive pages if they wanted a good table of contents,
syntax highlighting and so on. Soupault removes that dichotomy: it can do all the DOM manipulation you could do with JavaScript, but the result
is a static page.
</p>
<p>It can generate complete pages from a &ldquo;theme&rdquo; and content files, automatically modify existing pages, and extract site metadata.</p>

<p>
To get started, <a href="#downloads">download</a> and unpack a release archive. Then run <code>soupault --init</code> in an empty directory
to initialize a basic project, and then run <code>soupault</code> in that directory to build it. Generated pages will be in <code>build/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then read the <a href="/tips-and-tricks/quickstart">quick start guide</a> to learn how to set up a simple blog.

<a href="/tips-and-tricks/deployment/">deployment tips</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="html-aware">HTML-aware</h2>
<p>
Most static site generators are essentially CMSes that generate all pages at once rather than on demand.
HTML is an opaque format to them: they can <em>generate</em> it using a template processor,
but they cannot <em>manipulate</em> it. This limits what you can do with them: for example, pages with a unique
design can only be included as static assets.
</p>
<p>
Soupault makes HTML a first-class citizen. Like web browsers, it can parse HTML and manipulate the element tree of the page.
However, it saves the result in a static page rather than displays it on screen.
</p>
<p>
This allows features like <a href="/reference-manual/#footnotes-widget">footnotes</a> with automatic links in both directions,
and even an option to <a href="/reference-manual/#delete-element">delete unwanted HTML elements</a>.
It also means all features work the same regardless of the content file format.<fn id="format-independent">In some other projects
you may see a situation when both Markdown and reStructuredText are technically supported, but tables of contents or footnotes only work
for Markdown because it&apos;s an opaque feature of their Markdown processor. There&apos;s no such problems in soupault.</fn>
</p>
<p>
You can also use soupault as a post-processor for an <em>existing</em> website, whether hand-written or generated by another tool.
</p>
<p>
It also helps you avoid unnecessary client-side JavaScript and create pages <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">designed to last</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="dependency-free">Dependency-free</h2>
<p>
Soupault is available as a single, statically linked executable (~16&nbsp;MB) for Linux, macOS (x86_64 only, so far), and Microsoft Windows (64-bit).
</p>
<p>
It&apos;s easy to install on your own computer or incorporate in a <a href="/tips-and-tricks/deployment/">CI script</a>. Just download and unpack a release
archive and it&apos;s ready to use.
</p>
<p>This means you can keep using soupault indefinitely even if it becomes unmaintained.</p>
<p>
Even though you are never forced to upgrade to a new version, soupault tries to make upgrading as easy as possible too.
The maintainer uses <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, properly marks backwards-incompatible releases
with a major version change, and documents breaking changes.
</p>

<h2 id="unix-way">UNIX-way</h2>
<p>Soupault aims to do one thing: manipulate HTML element trees offline, and do it well.</p>
<p>
It purposely doesn&apos;t include things like a development web server, a Sass compiler, or an image processing library.
It avoids bloating the executable with built-in functionality that only some users will want, and that some users will want
to work <em>different from the built-in</em>.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it makes it easy to plug your own tools into the pipeline. Statically linked and dependency-free doesn&apos;t have to mean &ldquo;not extensible&rdquo;.
Soupault is extensible in several ways.
</p>

<h2 id="extensible">Extensible</h2>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>
Soupault comes with an embedded Lua interpreter, so it can be extended with <a href="/plugins">plugins</a>.
Its <a href="/reference-manual/#plugin-api">API</a> is similar to the JavaScript DOM API and allows you to manipulate pages in arbitrary ways.
</p>
<p>
There are many things plugins can do. They can expand custom elements to real HTML (think a static version of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">web components</a>,
or shortcodes on steroids). They can also call external programs, read data from files, and modify the entire page: not just the content, but also the HTML coming from the page template.
</p>

<h3>Page preprocessors</h3>
<p>
Soupault only supports HTML internally, but it allows you to bring your own <a href="/reference-manual/#page-preprocessors">page preprocessors</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thus it&apos;s possible to write pages in <em>any</em> format. Want to use CommonMark? Install <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a>
and add this to your <code>soupault.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
[preprocessors]
  md = "cmark --unsafe --smart"
</pre>
<p>Now all Markdown pages with <code>.md</code> extensions will be automatically converted to HTML by piping them through <code>cmark --unsafe --smart</code> command.</p>
<p>
You can use any external program as a page preprocessor, and you can have as many preprocessors as you want. Whether you are a fan of
<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, <a href="https://asciidoctor.org">AsciiDoctor</a> or something elseâ€”as long as it can read from standard input
and write HTML to standard output, you can use it as a preprocessor.
</p>

<h3>Element preprocessors</h3>
<p>
It&apos;s also possible to pipe HTML <em>elements</em> through external programs.
Those programs have access to the element tag names and attributes via environment variables.
</p>
<p>
This is how you can add syntax highlighting to code samples in <code>&lt;pre class="language-something"&gt;</code> elements.
Assuming you have <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php">highlight</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> installed:
</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
# Runs the content of &lt;* class="language-*"&gt; elements through a syntax highlighter
[widgets.syntax-highlighting]
  widget = "preprocess_element"
  selector = '*[class^="language-"]'
  command = 'highlight -O html -f --inline-css --syntax=$(echo $ATTR_CLASS | sed -e "s/language-//")'
  action = "replace_content"
</pre>

<h3>Content model</h3>
<p>
Soupault allows you to define your own content model. There is no front matter, metadata is <a href="/reference-manual/#metadata-extraction-and-rendering">extracted directly from HTML</a> using
CSS selectors, similar to how <a href="https://microformats.org/">microformats</a> and web scrapers work.
</p>
<p>For example, this is how you can say <q>use <code>&lt;h1 id="post-title"&gt;</code> for the post title if a page has one, else just use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></q>:</p>
<pre class="language-toml">
[index.fields]
  title = { selector = ["h1#post-title", "h1"] }
</pre>
<p>
Extracted metadata can be rendered on pages using a built-in <a href="http://tategakibunko.github.io/jingoo/">template processor</a> or an external script.
You can also export it to a JSON file for further processing.
</p>

<h2>Why it&apos;s named soupault?</h2>
<p>
Soupault is named after the French dadaist and surrealist writer <wikipedia>Philippe Soupault</wikipedia>
because it&apos;s based on the <github project="aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</github> library.
Its development is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.college-de-pataphysique.org/">College of &apos;Pataphysics</a>.<fn id="pataphysics">Not really.</span>
</p>

<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>
Soupault logo is a stick horse. It&apos;s a reference to the meeting where Philippe Soupault et al. chose a name for their movement by opening a dictionary
at a random word and landed on <q>dada (n.), a colloquial for a stick horse</q>, which is why they named it &ldquo;dadaism&rdquo;.

<h2>Who&apos;s behind it?</h2>
<p>
So far just me, <a href="https://baturin.org">Daniil Baturin</a>, but everyone is welcome to send a patch/pull request or a suggestion.
It has grown out of the bunch of ad hoc scripts that used to power my own website, and then I thought I can as well make it usable
for everyone who finds other generators too annoying or too limiting.
