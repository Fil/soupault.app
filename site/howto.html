<p>
This is a simple &ldquo;how to&rdquo; page to help new users get started with soupault.
For advanced usage such as automatic section indexing, external scripts, and Lua plugins,
consult the <a href="https://baturin.org/projects/soupault">reference manual</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="project-setup">How to setup a basic project</h3>
<p>
Run <code>soupault --init</code> in an empty directory. It will create the following directory structure and files:
</p>
<pre>
.
├── site
│   └── index.html
├── soupault.conf
└── templates
    └── main.html
</pre>
<p>
The <code>site/</code> directory is where your page content files go. The <code>templates/main.html</code> is
the page template. The <code>soupault.conf</code> file is the configuration file for soupault, in the TOML format.
</p>
<p>
If you run <code>soupault</code> in that directory, it will build your website and place the processed pages in
the <code>build/</code> directory. You can then deploy your website with any tool of your choice, like
<code>neocities push</code>, rsync, or anything else.
</p>

<h3 id="assets">How to add assets (pictures, CSS...)</h3>
<p>
You can just drop files in the <code>site/</code> directory together with pages. Files with extensions
matching the <code>page_file_extensions</code> are considered pages and processed, by default that's
<code>["html", "htm", "md", "rst", "adoc"]</code>. All other files are just copied to the <code>build/</code>
directory unchanged.
</p>

<h3 id="sections">How to create a site section</h3>

<p>
Just create a subdirectory in <code>site/</code>. Every subdirectory automatically becomes a section,
e.g. <code>site/pictures/cats.html</code> becomes <code>build/pictures/cats/index.html</code> if clean URLs
are enabled, or <code>build/pictures/cats.html</code> if they are disabled.
</p>
<p>
They can be nested as deep as you want, there is no depth limit. However, section index pages is your responsibility,
so if you want <code>https://example.com/pictures</code> to work, you should also add <code>site/pictures/index.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
Soupault can be configured to generate a list of all pages in a section, but there still must be a section index page,
whether you are maintaining a list of pages in the section by hand or using a script to generate it.
</p>

<h3 id="clean-urls">How to disable clean URLs</h3>
<p>
Soupault uses &ldquo;clean URLs&rdquo; by default. This means a page like <code>site/about.html</code>
turns into <code>build/about/index.html</code>, so that on deployed website it can be accessed as
<code>http://example.com/about</code>.
<p>
<p>
For a new website, the choice between <code>/about/</code> and <code>/about.html</code> is purely aesthetic,
but for people who already have a website and want to switch to managing it with soupault, it can be a real
show stopper since it can break all their links. For this reason, soupault has a <code>clean_urls</code>
option. Use <code>clean_urls = false</code> if you want to disable it.
</p>
<p>
With <code>clean_urls = false</code>, soupault preserves file names exactly, e.g. <code>site/about.htm</code>
becomes <code>build/about.htm</code>, and <code>site/projects/soupault.html</code> becomes
<code>build/projects/soupault.html</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="building">Building your site from pieces</h2>

<h3 id="content-selector">Where the page content goes</h3>
<p>
When soupault builds your website, it takes the empty page template from <code>templates/main.html</code>,
reads content from files in <code>site/</code> such as <code>site/about.html</code>, and inserts it in the template.
</p>
<p>
By default, it will insert the page content into the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of the page template.
</p>
<p>
However, you can insert page content into any element using the <code>content_selector</code> option
in the <code>[settings]</code> section.
Suppose you want your page content to go to <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code>. Then add that div
to <code>templates/main.html</code>, find that option in <code>soupault.conf</code>,
and set it to <code>content_selector = "div#content"</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="unique-layout">How to create a page with unique layout</h3>
<p>
Using a template saves time and allows easily changing the website layout. However, what if you want to make a page
with a unique layout different from the template?
</p>
<p>
Soupault decides whether to use a template or not by checking if a page file has an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in it.
It it does not have it, then the file is considered a page body and inserted in the template. If it does, then it's considered
a complete page and only processed by widgets/plugins.
</p>
<p>
So, to make a unique page, just make it a complete HTML document.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to exclude it from some widgets using the <code>exclude_page</code> option.
</p>

<h3 id="include-file">How to include external files in pages</h3>
<p>
Suppose all your pages have the same header and footer, and you want to keep them in separate files,
e.g. <code>templates/header.html</code> and <code>templates/footer.html</code>. Suppose your header should be in a
<code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code> and the footer should be in the <code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
First, add <code>div</code>'s with those ids to your <code>templates/main.html</code>.
Then add this to your <code>soupault.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.header]
  widget = "include"
  selector = "div#header"
  file = "templates/header.html"

[widgets.footer]
  widget = "include"
  selector = "div#footer"
  file = "templates/footer.html"  
</pre>

<h3 id="include-html">How to insert an HTML snippet</h3>

<p>
Sometimes you just need a small snippet that makes no sense to keep in a separate file.
Suppose you want to add an analytics script to your pages, just one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag
in the head. You can do it like this:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.analytics-script]
  widget = "insert_html"
  selector = "head"
  html = '&lt;script src="/scripts/evil-analytics.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;'
</pre>

<h2 id="enhancing">Enhancing your pages</h2>

<h3 id="set-title">How to automatically set page title</h3>
<p>
A website where every page has the same <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is a sad sight.
Soupault can set the page title from an element of your choice. This is the config
for this page, that takes the title from an element with <code>id="title"</code>.
In this page it's a <code>h1</code>, but it could be anything.
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.page-title]
  widget = "title"
  selector = "#title"
  default = "soupault"
  append = " &mdash; soupault"
</pre>

<h3 id="toc">How to add a table of contents</h3>
<p>
Soupault can automatically generate tables of contents from heading tags.
This is the config for this very page:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.table-of-contents]
  widget = "toc"
  selector = "#generated-toc"

  min_level = 2

  toc_list_class = "toc"
  toc_class_levels = false

  numbered_list = true

  heading_links = true
  heading_link_text = "→ "
  heading_link_class = "here"

  use_heading_slug = true
</pre>
<p>
Remember to add a <code>&lt;div id="generated-toc"&gt;</code> to <code>templates/main.html</code>
if you want a ToC in every page, or just to pages where you want it.
</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">How to add footnotes</h3>
<p>
If you like footnotes, you can add them to your pages easily. This is the config for this website:
</p>
<pre>
[widgets.footnotes]
  widget = "footnotes"
  selector = "div#footnotes"
  footnote_selector = ".footnote"
  footnote_link_class = "footnote"
  back_links = true
  link_id_prepend = "footnote-"
  back_link_id_append = "-ref"
</pre>
<p>
It assumes that there's a <code>&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;</code> in the page.
If you forget to include it in the page, footnotes will not appear.
</p>
<p>
It considers elements with <code>class="footnote"</code> footnotes and moves them
to that div. The <code>back_links</code> option creates links back from footnotes
to their original location, you can set it to <code>false</code> if you don't like
those links back.
</p>

<h2 id="extending">Extending soupault's capabilities</h2>

<h3 id="preprocessors">How to use Markdown and other formats</h3>
<p>
Unlike many other static website generators, soupault treats HTML as a first-class citizen.
In fact, it's the only format it treats that way, there's no built-in support for any other
format. If you are switching from another generator like Jekyll, or simply want to use Markdown
for some pages that don't need advanced markup, it can be quite limiting though.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that you can write pages in any format as long as you have a program that converts
it to HTML. You just need to specify a preprocessor program for a file extension, and soupault
will call it automatically.
</p>
<p>
For Markdown, I suggest the <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a> program.
On GNU/Linux you can install it from repositories and on macOS you can get it from
<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cmark">homebrew</a>. I couldn't find a prebuild version
for Windows though, so I made one (v.0.29.0): <a href="/files/cmark.exe">cmark.exe</a>.
To use it, just add this to your <code>soupault.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre>
[preprocessors]
  md = "cmark"
</pre>
<p>
Make sure the program is in your <code>PATH</code>. If it's not, you can specify an absolute path there,
like <code>md = '/opt/cmark/bin/cmark'</code> or <code>md = 'C:\cmark\cmark.exe'</code>.
</p>
<p>
You can specify preprocessors for as many extensions as you want, so you can easily use multiple formats
at once.
</p>

<h2 id="edge-cases">Edge cases</h2>

<h3 id="page-section-collision">What happens if you have a directory and a page with the same name</h3>
<p>
Don't do it. It's undefined behaviour and anything may happen.
</p>
<p>
In the current versions, if you have clean URLs enabled and there are both <code>site/test.html</code>
and <code>site/test/index.html</code>, then the latter will be used. But it just happens to be this way
and may change any time, so don't count on it.
</p>
